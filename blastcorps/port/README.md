# port/: Windows build (stage 0 spike)

A 32-bit (i686) Windows exe that maps the N64's 8 MB of RDRAM at
0x80000000 and runs the game's NON_MATCHING C against it. Nothing in
`src.us.v11/` changes for this; the matching build is untouched.

```
make VERSION=us.v11 NON_MATCHING=1 -j8   # build_nm/ ELFs: the address source
make VERSION=us.v11 -j8                  # build/ ELFs: the reference for `check`
make -C port -j8                         # port/build/spike.exe
make -C port check                       # run it, compare with the original MIPS code
make -C port linkall                     # every hd_code game file in one exe
make -C port typemap ucode               # byte-order schema coverage / RSP microcode hashes
```

Needs `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc` (WSL), the project venv (pyelftools, unicorn),
host `gcc` (for `typemap`) and the ROM at run time (`ROM=`, default
`../baserom.us.v11.z64` or `~/blastcorps/baserom.us.v11.z64`). The exe gets
a Windows path through `wslpath -w`.

## How it fits together

1. **RDRAM.** `src/rdram.c` reserves and commits 8 MB at 0x80000000 with
   `VirtualAlloc`. The exe is linked `--large-address-aware` (without it,
   addresses at or above 2 GB don't exist for the process),
   `--disable-dynamicbase` and `--disable-reloc-section`. Absolute symbols
   must never be rebased, so the image always loads at 0x400000.
2. **Game C.** Each game file is compiled to assembly with
   `-DNON_MATCHING -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -msse2 -mfpmath=sse`. The
   port's `include/port_ultratypes.h` is forced in. `-fno-builtin-{sin,cos}{,f}`
   keeps the libultra versions, because gcc otherwise turns sinf and cosf into
   `sincosf`.
3. **Pinning data (`tools/relabel.py`).** Every data object the C defines that
   the NON_MATCHING ELF places at an N64 address becomes an absolute symbol at
   that address. Its native initialiser is kept under `__native_<name>`, and
   `build/copytab.c` lists these. Start-up copies the initialisers over the
   image, already in host byte order and layout. The copy is checked against
   the N64 `st_size`. Function-local statics (`D_xxxxxxxx.N`) are pinned by
   name.
4. **Undefined symbols (`tools/gensyms.py link`).** Data symbols become
   `_name = 0x8xxxxxxx;` lines in `build/abs_syms.ld`, an implicit linker
   script. Functions that no linked object defines become traps in
   `build/stubs.c`. Compiler and C-runtime helpers come from libgcc/msvcrt.
5. **Image load (`rdram_load`).** The hd_code `.data`/`.rodata` gzip member
   (ROM 0x7D73B4) is inflated to 0x802E8BD0, and the front end (text+ucode,
   data) to 0x801E7000/0x80208040. Both `.bss` ranges are cleared, then the
   native initialisers are copied in. The hd_code text is not loaded; its
   tables are C (NM_PIN_HD_CODE).
6. **Byte order.** Image bytes that came from the ROM are big-endian. Code
   reads them natively only after they are swapped by type. `tools/typemap.py`
   derives a per-symbol leaf layout (offset, width) from the DWARF of every
   game file's declarations. `spike_main.c` swaps what its tests read. Stage 3
   applies the full map.

## The spike's tests (`src/spike_main.c`, reference `tools/n64ref.py`)

`n64ref.py` runs the same cases through the original code (`build/`, unicorn,
memory big-endian). `check` compares the outputs line by line:

| test | function | reads | typed | raw (no swap) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | func_802AD7D4/7FC arcsine (69000.c) | u16 table D_802AD880 in a .text bin, defined in 69930.c | 65536/65536 | 9/65536 |
| T2 | func_802A56C4 (60D50.c) | s16 D_80305B90[][3] in a hd .data bin | 21/21 | 3/21 |
| T3 | func_802A5510 (60D50.c) | level asset (s32 offsets + s16 HeightZones) in the heap | 300/300 | 26/300 (274 access violations) |
| T4 | func_802CB690 (86ED0.c, vehicle helper) | .bss only; records its calls | 200/200 | 200/200 |
