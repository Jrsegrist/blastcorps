/* N64 pointers in the port build (port/README.md, "64-bit").
 *
 * N64 memory keeps its N64 layout in every build: a pointer stored in it
 * (a struct field, a pinned global, a table element) is 4 bytes.  The game
 * and SDK headers mark such pointers; in the 64-bit build the marks give
 * 4-byte pointers, everywhere else they expand to nothing (the IDO builds
 * get empty versions from include/2.0I/PR/ultratypes.h).
 *
 *   T * N64P x            an N64 pointer: `__ptr32 __uptr` (4 bytes, zero-
 *                         extended when loaded) on x86_64 (clang with
 *                         -fms-extensions, MSVC); N64PTR(T) is the same type
 *                         for casts: `*(N64PTR(u8) *) p`
 *   N64FN(T) x            a function pointer field of type T (a pointer-to-
 *                         function typedef): a u32 on x86_64 (clang can't use
 *                         __ptr32 function pointers), set with N64FN_SET(f, fn)
 *                         and read with N64FN_GET(T, f); code addresses are in
 *                         the exe image, below 4 GB
 *   N64_IPTR(x)           a signed 32-bit integer that holds an address, about
 *                         to be cast to a pointer: zero-extended on x86_64
 *                         (`(u8 *) N64_IPTR(x)`), not sign-extended
 *   N64_DPTR(x)           a pointer in a static initialiser of N64 data: 0 on
 *                         x86_64, where the start-up pointer table (gensyms.py
 *                         ptrtab) writes the NON_MATCHING ELF's value there
 *   N64_A32               the type of a 32-bit int that holds an N64 address
 *                         added to a pointer (`m += (N64_A32) buf`): s32
 *                         elsewhere, u32 on x86_64 (pointer + s32 sign-extends
 *                         an address >= 0x80000000)
