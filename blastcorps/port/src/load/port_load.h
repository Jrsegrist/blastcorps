/* Byte order on load (stage 3, "load").
 *
 * The RDRAM image is kept in host (little-endian) order: everything the
 * game's C reads natively must be swapped once, when it arrives from the ROM,
 * by the width the code reads it at.  Two entry points:
 *
 *  - the data images (hd_code .data/.rodata at 0x802E8BD0, the front end's at
 *    0x80208040): swapped by a table generated at build time
 *    (port/tools/swaptab.py: C declarations + traced read widths), right after
 *    they are inflated and before the native initialisers are copied in;
 *  - runtime assets: port_on_dma (every PI DMA, from the platform layer) and
 *    port_on_load (after the game decompresses a block: func_8028B4C4 and
 *    5CB60's packed-object loader), which look the ROM range up in the asset
 *    table (port_assets.c) and apply that asset type's schema.
 *
 * Textures, palettes, compressed streams and the byte streams the code reads
 * with BE16U/BE16S/BE32 or byte loads stay big-endian.
