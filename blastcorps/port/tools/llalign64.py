"""Clamp the alignment of every memory access in an LLVM IR module to 4 bytes.

The x86-64 ABI gives a global array of 16 bytes or more 16-byte alignment and
clang assumes it for every array it sees, extern ones included; it then uses
aligned SSE accesses (movaps) on them.  N64 data sits at N64 addresses with
N64 alignment (D_8036B8C8 is 8-aligned): such an access faults.  No clang
option turns the assumption off, and the attribute that would (aligned on
each declaration) can't be applied by #pragma clang attribute, so the 64-bit
build compiles the game code to optimised IR, lowers every `align N` above 4
on globals and memory operations (not on stack slots: allocas stay aligned),
and only then generates code (port64.mk).  Lowering an alignment is always
correct; it only costs aligned-load forms the game code hardly uses.

usage: llalign64.py IN.ll OUT.ll [ADDRS]
  ADDRS: the pinned symbols (gensyms.py addrs), whose definitions are lowered too
